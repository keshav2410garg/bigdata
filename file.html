    <h3>ARE YOU READY?</h3>
    <p><b>Big Data is a phrase used to mean a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is so large it is difficult to process using traditional database and software techniques. In most enterprise scenarios the volume of data is too big or it moves too fast or it exceeds current processing capacity.</b></p>
    <p><b>Data is probably the world’s most valuable natural resource. Like oil, 20% of data is on the surface and easily searchable, and 80% is hidden and difficult to access.
However, unlike oil the same data can be refined, merged and reused many times over and data is growing exponentially whereas oil is a finite resource.
Thus, if one would be able to find and access all the discovered and undiscovered data within a particular organization, he will definitely be a superhero in the organization.

<p><b>The Secret Formula can be broken down into four steps:</b></p>
<p><b>1. Use what you have: Incorporate such a system which would keep both – the communities that are previously using the system as well as the late technology adapters happy.
<br>
2. Buy what you need: prioritize which capabilities are absolutely essential to change the business, which can take the business to greater heights and which are merely nice to have.
<br>
3. Remember the basics: never forget the basics like security, governance, metadata management, modeling and sharing. Prioritize these and roll them out throughout your project’s lifecycle.
<br>
4. Iterate, iterate and iterate some more.</b></p>
<br>
<h5>COMING TO THE CONCLUSION NOW...</h5>
<p><b>1. REMEMBER YOUR BASICS
  <br>
   2. KEEP LEARNING NEW THINGS
   <br>
   3. KEEP IT SIMPLE
</b></p>
<p1><b>FOLLLOWING THESE WILL SURELY MAKE YOU A BIG DATA SUPERHERO. ONE WHO SHALL TAKE THE WORLD TO NEW HEIGHTS OF INNOVATION AND INVENTION FOR THE NEED OF A BIG DATA SUPER HERO IS IMMINENT AND HIS HELP, NECESSARY.</b></p1>
